# 🎙️ Speech Cleaner – Digital Signal Processing Project

## 📌 Overview
**Speech Cleaner** is a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) application that demonstrates how noise
can be added to a speech signal and then removed using digital filtering techniques.  
The project allows users to **load or record speech**, **add noise**, and **apply filters**
to analyze and compare the original, noisy, and cleaned speech signals in both time and frequency domains.

This project is designed for **DSP coursework**, **signal processing demonstrations**, and **audio analysis practice**.
